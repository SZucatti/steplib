title: Versioning utility
summary: |-
  This step extends version and build number provided as parameters (`Version number`, `Build number`) with a pre-release identifier (`Pre-release identifier`, e.g. `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`)
  and a pre-release number. The build number is optional and it's not incremented. The pre-release number is automatically incremented based on the existing git tags.
  If there are no tags for the provided version, pre-release number is set to the initial value (`Pre-release initial value`).
  Pre-release information is exported to the following environment variables:
  - **APP_PRE_RELEASE_INFO** (e.g. `rc.3`)
  - **APP_VERSION_WITH_PRE_RELEASE_INFO** (e.g. `v2.0-rc.3`)
  You can use these environment variables in next steps (e.g. when creating a git tag).
